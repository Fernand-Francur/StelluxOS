  <h1>Stellux OS</h1>
  
  <p>
    StelluxOS is a personal operating system project inspired by Symbiote project's philosophy of providing runtime privilege
    level switching mechanism for userspace threads. This would ultimately allow the kernel to be a pool of hot-swappable and
    restartable components that can elevate themselves when performing privileged tasks and staying lowered the rest of the time.

  This branch is currently in very early development and acts as a remake of a prototype
